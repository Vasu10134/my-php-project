## Project Overview
This project is a basic PHP application created as a learning exercise using XAMPP.  
When accessed in a browser, it dynamically shows:

- My name
- Current server time
- Status of the application (running)
It's a perfect starter project for understanding PHP basics and server-side rendering.

## Features
- Dynamic greeting with your name
- Displays current server time
- Confirms that the application is running

## Technologies
- PHP
- XAMPP (Apache + MySQL)
- HTML

## Setup & Installation
Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. **Install XAMPP** from [Apache Friends](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) if not already installed.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vasu10134/my-php-project.git

Move the project folder to your XAMPP htdocs directory:
C:\xampp\htdocs\my-first-project
Start Apache from the XAMPP Control Panel.
Open your browser and navigate to:
http://localhost/my-first-project

Usage
Once running, you should see:
Hi, [Your Name] üëã
The current server time is [HH:MM:SS AM/PM].
The app is running successfully!

If you want, I can also **add a fancier ‚Äúlive greeting‚Äù feature section** showing the greeting updating in real-time with server time, to make your README look more professional and interactive.  
Do you want me to do that?
